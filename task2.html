          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>
            The next morning, Amal and Sachin leave for the airport and Reenu joins them. En route, Aadhi and his goons ambush them, but Reenu saves Sachin and Amal by incapacitating Aadhi with the pepper spray that Aadhi himself had given her and the other female staff in their office for self-defense. Reenu confesses her love to Sachin and says "From now on, we are in a long-distance relationship. Let's see how that goes" and bids farewell at the airport. At the end, there is a throwback to a previous scene of Karthika, Niharika and Reenu sitting together on the terrace, where Karthika asks Niharika to find a boy for Reenu. Then, Niharika accepts the task and throws a beer can over the terrace saying that whoever it lands on will be Reenu's future husband; it lands on Sachin as he is walking with Amal.
